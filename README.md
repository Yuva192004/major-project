# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions within credit card data. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers. Detecting fraudulent activities promptly is crucial to mitigate financial losses and maintain trust in the banking system.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical credit card transactions, including various features such as transaction amount, location, and transaction method. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be provided directly in this repository. However, you can obtain similar datasets from public repositories like Kaggle.

## Approach
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Exploration of dataset characteristics, distribution, and relationships between variables.
- Visualizations including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and more to gain insights.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
- Creation of new features such as 'transaction_hour' to capture relevant information.

### Modeling:
- Training various classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using cross-validation techniques.

### Model Evaluation:
- Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Holdout validation and testing on unseen data to ensure model generalization.
